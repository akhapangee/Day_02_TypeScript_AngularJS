function add(x,y){
	return x+y;
}

console.log(add(5,3));
console.log(add("5","3"));
console.log(add("fjkd","fjkd"));

As all these scenarioes are valid, it's difficult to work on error handling in javascript. So, typescript was introduced to overcome
this scenario.

INSTALL typescript
npm install -g typescript

COMPILE
tsc filename.ts

After we use tsconfig.json file (which is similar to pom in java), we can compile using only 'tsc'
